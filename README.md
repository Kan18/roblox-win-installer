Python script to download, install and authenticate Roblox Studio in a CI environment.

Run with a ROBLOSECURITY cookie as an argument.

Please check the script carefully before running it on your machine as it takes some destructive actions (such as deleting your local Roblox directory)

What this script does not do, but you should do before running tests:

-   Update %LocalAppData%\GlobalSettings_13.xml to set EditQualityLevel to 1
