Python script to download, install and authenticate Roblox Studio.

Run with a ROBLOSECURITY cookie as an argument.

What this script does not do, but you should do before running tests:

- Ensure The Documents\Roblox directory does not exist, to prevent the save recovery dialogue from blocking tests
- Update %LocalAppData%\GlobalSettings_13.xml to set EditQualityLevel to 1
